Program sorting 200 bytes of data, once by using a sequential vector, and another time, by using a vector with pointers and objects created with "new"

Spoiler: The test with pointers was faster, which might be expected, considering it only needs to swap 8 bytes of data, instead of 200 bytes for the other one
